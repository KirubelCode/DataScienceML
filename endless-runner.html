        <h1>Learn More - Endless Runner Game</h1>
        <p>
            The Endless Runner Game is a dynamic and engaging project inspired by the mechanics of 
            <a href="https://www.geometrydash.io/" target="_blank">Geometry Dash</a>. This game was built using x68 assembly language, showcasing a deep understanding of low-level programming concepts.
        </p>

        <h2>Acknowledgment of Template</h2>
        <p>
            This project is built upon a starter template provided by [Philip Bourke] for course [SE603]. The template offered a foundational structure, including trap codes for screen size, key inputs, and double buffering. Modifications were made to expand functionality and transform the basic structure into a complete game experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Modifications Implemented</h2>
        <p>
            Below are the key features and modifications added to create the Endless Runner Game:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text Display:</strong> Added in-game text updates for difficulty levels, player score, and lives remaining. Displays game over messages and prompts for restart.</li>
            <li><strong>Sound Integration:</strong> Incorporated sound effects for player actions (jumping, collisions) and game events.</li>
            <li><strong>Player Mechanics:</strong> Developed player movement mechanics, including constant X-axis movement, jumping, and landing.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Progression:</strong> Designed a dynamic difficulty system where enemy speed increases based on player score.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Over and Restart:</strong> Implemented a system where losing 3 lives ends the game, with an option to restart by pressing Enter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The player controls a character that constantly moves along the X-axis while dodging enemy blocks. The challenge lies in jumping over enemies, with the difficulty increasing as the game progresses. Colliding with an enemy results in a loss of one life, and losing all three lives ends the game. The player can restart the game by pressing Enter.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
            The Endless Runner Game uses x68 assembly language to directly manage system-level operations, including graphics rendering, input handling, and game logic. Trap codes are utilised for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screen size information and double buffering.</li>
            <li>Listening for key inputs (e.g., spacebar for jumping, escape for exiting).</li>
            <li>Setting cursor positions and displaying text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Additionally, custom algorithms were implemented for player movement, gravity simulation, enemy speed adjustment, and collision detection.
        </p>
